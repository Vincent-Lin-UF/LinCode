# Privacy Policy

This extension does not collect, store, or transmit any personally identifiable information. All processing is done locally in the user's browser. We do not use analytics, ads, or trackers. No data is sent to external servers.

This extension operates only on `leetcode.com` to add a "Share" button to daily challenge pages. It reads visible page content (like problem title, runtime, and language) and performs a single fetch to another LeetCode page to extract the problem's difficulty. The fetched HTML is parsed locally. No dynamic code is executed.

This extension is not affiliated with or endorsed by LeetCode.
